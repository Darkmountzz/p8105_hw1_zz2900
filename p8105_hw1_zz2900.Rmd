## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r penguins}

data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
penguins

```

* the data in this dataset, including names / values of important variables

There are 8 important variables in the penguins dataset. These 8 variables are species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year

* the size of the dataset (using nrow and ncol)

* the mean flipper length

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
